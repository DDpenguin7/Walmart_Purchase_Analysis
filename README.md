# Walmart Customer Purchase Analysis â€“ Project Overview

Walmart is one of the worldâ€™s largest retail chains, operating thousands of stores globally and offering a wide variety of products to millions of customers. With increasing demand for data-driven decision-making, this project analyzes customer transaction data to derive patterns in sales, product performance, and store-level dynamics.
